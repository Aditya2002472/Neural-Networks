# Simple Neural Network

This repository contains a basic implementation of a feedforward neural network using Python. The network is trained with the backpropagation algorithm to minimize errors between predicted and expected outputs.

## Features

- **Feedforward Network**: Includes an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer.
- **Backpropagation**: Training through error minimization by adjusting weights and biases.
- **Sigmoid Activation**: Non-linear activation using the sigmoid function.

## Files

- `neural_network.py`: Main implementation of the neural network.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network.git
    cd neural-network
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python neural_network.py
    ```
